# Skill: run-all-tests

Run all tests across the entire RealmEngine/Veldrath monorepo (~3,870 .NET tests in 7 test projects) with code coverage collection, then the web suites.

## Usage

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Verify all tests pass before committing, pushing, or merging
- Generate code coverage reports for CI/CD or local analysis
- Validate that recent changes don't break existing functionality

## Requirements

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) installed (10.0.x)
- Repository root as the working directory (any OS shell; PowerShell optional)
- Solution must build successfully first (see [build-full](../build-full/SKILL.md))

## Steps

1. **Ensure the solution builds** (tests won't run if compilation fails):

   ```bash
   dotnet build Realm.Full.slnx
   ```

2. **Run all tests with coverage collection:**

   ```bash
   dotnet test Realm.Full.slnx --collect "XPlat Code Coverage" --settings coverage.runsettings
   ```

   This runs tests from all 7 .NET test projects and collects coverage data per component.

3. **Review results:**
   - Test results stream to the console in real time.
   - A summary line in each project shows: `Passed! - Failed: 0, Passed: <n>, Skipped: 0, Total: <n>`; the suite total is ~3,870.
   - Coverage results are written to `TestResults/` directories under each test project. The `coverage.runsettings` file controls which assemblies and methods are included/excluded.

## Test Project Breakdown

| Test Project | Tests | Coverage Flag |
|---|---|---|
| `RealmEngine.Core.Tests` | Feature/unit tests for engine core | `engine` |
| `RealmEngine.Shared.Tests` | Shared model/utility tests | `engine` |
| `RealmEngine.Data.Tests` | Repository/persistence tests | `engine` |
| `Veldrath.Server.Tests` | Server integration tests | `server` |
| `Veldrath.Discord.Tests` | Discord bot tests | `discord` |
| `Veldrath.Assets.Tests` | Asset management tests | — |

The SvelteKit web suite runs with `npm run test` from `web/` (Vitest + Playwright, `web` coverage flag).

## Notes

- **`ExcludeFromCodeCoverage`** is applied at the assembly level in each test project's `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` — test projects themselves are excluded from coverage.
- **Coverage runsettings** are configured in [`coverage.runsettings`](../../coverage.runsettings) — modify this file to adjust exclusion rules or threshold requirements.
- **EF Core test projects** use the `InMemory` provider by default. `Veldrath.Server.Tests` uses SQLite for integration tests where SQL semantics matter.
- If you encounter `dotnet test` hanging, add `--no-build` if the build hasn't changed, or use `-v n` (normal verbosity) for more detail.
